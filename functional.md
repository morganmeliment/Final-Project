# Solve Dots



## Functional Specification

This document should become the functional specification of the project you are working on.

A functional specification describes in great detail how a device or program will appear to an
outside user. That is, it treats all hardware as a "black box", the contents of which are completely
unknown to the user. The functional specification should include sections with the following information:

Your specification **should include** the following types of information:

* A title. Replace the title at the beginning of this document.
* Summary or introduction. In general, in a few lines or less, what is your program about or what is it about?
* How does the user access your program? Is it shared via http://runpython.com? Is a web site? Embedded in 
  a single board computer? 
* If there are graphics screens involved, describe every screen that the user will experience: what is it for? 
  What did the user have to do to get there and how does she move on to the next?
* For each graphics screen, describe every active control input and what it does. What elements on the screen will
  change in response to user input?
* Does the program respond to mouse input? What, exactly, does the mouse do?
* Does the program respond to keyboard input? How?
* What graphical assets will be used?
* Does the user have to do anything to install the program?

Your specification should **not** include the following types of information:

* The language you will use to create it.
* Names of any specific files in the project.
* How you will structure the classes, functions and code in your program.
* The name of any files or tools that you will use to design the program.
* 



Introduction:
Solve Dots is an app that allows you to cheat in dots. It tells you the best move based on your board. There are currently no dots solvers on the app store despite the app have millions of downloads.

It will be available on the app store.

The graphics are solely the default ui. There is one button that allows the user to select a screenshot.

The program does not respond to mouse or keyboard input.

The only graphical asset is the icon, which I made a high-resolution copy of the real dots icon in Inkscape.

The user will have to download the app from the App Store once it is made available.
